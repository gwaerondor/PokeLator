#The Pokélator
Pokémon Sun and Moon will finally include the options to play the game in Chinese!
For those of us who grew up with the English Pokémon names, there will be an initial hurdle to overcome to learn the more-than-seven-hundred names in a new language.

This tool, when finished, will help with that.
It has a simple interface with a search box, and boxes with search results in each language.

Anything can be entered into the search box. If there is a hit in the Pokédex number, English name, name in simplified Chinese or in traditional Chinese, the hits will be listed showing each of those fields. Partial hits will also be shown.

The cantonese names used in Hong Kong are also included, even though they will unfortunately not be in the officially translated versions of the games.

# Running the tool
The tool is written in Java. No standalone executable exists yet, as the tool is not finished.
Java will be the only requirement.
